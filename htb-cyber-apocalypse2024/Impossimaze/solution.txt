The challenge gave a hint to NCurses, i am not sure but it is related to text based interface.

If we look at the code, there's "getmaxx" and "getmaxy" functions used, which returns max x or y coordinate.

These values are compared with 13 and 37 respectively, and if it passes, it executes the statement inside the condition, if we just set manually using stty 

stty rows 13 cols 37

and run the challenge, we get the flag displayed.
